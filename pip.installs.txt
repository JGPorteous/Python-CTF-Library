PIP Installs - Useful Libraries for CTF Competitions
----------------------------------------------------

#Upgrade python
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip --user

#Crypto Libraries for Python
pip install pycryptodome

# https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/
# gmpy2 is an optimized, C-coded Python extension module that supports fast multiple-precision arithmetic. gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module. gmpy2 adds support for correctly rounded multiple-precision real arithmetic (using the MPFR library) and complex arithmetic (using the MPC library).
pip install gmpy2

# https://pypi.org/project/pwntools/
# Pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.
pip install pwn --user


# https://pypi.org/project/libnum/
# This is a python library for some numbers functions:
#  - working with primes (generating, primality tests)
#  - common maths (gcd, lcm, n'th root)
#  - modular arithmetics (inverse, Jacobi symbol, square root, solve CRT)
#  - converting strings to numbers or binary strings
# Library may be used for learning/experimenting/research purposes. Should NOT be used for secure crypto implementations.
pip install libnum 


# https://pypi.org/project/sympy/
# Python Library for Symbolic Mathematics
pip install sympy --user
